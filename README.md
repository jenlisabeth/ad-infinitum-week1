# ad-infinitum-week1
First week of the Ad Infinitum Game Jam.

# Game Idea: Unfair Tetris (Gravity & Physics)
This is tetris like you never played before, It has real world physics! Blocks have weights, velocities, there is gravity, friction and more.
Have fun!

# Problems I faced (with solutions):

# Mechanics and more:
The game has 2 modes (story and arcade)
In story you go against the game's AI which gets progressivelly less fair. Giving you skewed blocks, extra gravity, sticky blocks, wierd block turning and more!
Arcade mode is a glorified randomizer, you get some random attributes of the game for your personal enjoyment!
